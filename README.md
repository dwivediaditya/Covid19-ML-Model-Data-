# Case Study: 
Analysing the Outbreak of COVID 19 using Machine Learning

Problem Statement
We need a strong model that predicts how the virus could spread across different countries and regions. The goal of this task is to build a model that predicts the spread of the virus in the next 7 days.

ðŸ”´NOTE: The model was built on a test dataset updated till April,â€™20. But you can access the source to these datasets at the â€˜John Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Centreâ€™ which gets updated on a daily basis, so you can run this model for the date you prefer.

Tasks to be performed:
Analysing the present condition in India
Is this trend similar to Italy/South Korea/ Wuhan
Exploring the world wide data
Forecasting the worldwide COVID-19 cases using Prophet
